This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [RTLA Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways you can contribute to RTLA, from writing code and improving documentation, to reporting bugs and suggesting enhancements.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for RTLA. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report:**

- Check the [issues](https://github.com/vsguzev/rtla/issues) for a list of current known issues.
- Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?**

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vsguzev/rtla/issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem with as much detail as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs if possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for RTLA, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

**Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion:**

- Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vsguzev/rtla/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
- Determine whether your idea is suitable for the project and aligns with the goals and scope of RTLA.

**How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?**

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vsguzev/rtla/issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as much detail as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples.
- Describe the current behavior and how your feature would change that behavior.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most RTLA users.
- List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to RTLA? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/vsguzev/rtla/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/vsguzev/rtla/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

- Fill in [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
- Follow the [Rust style guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustfmt/index.html).
- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) tests in your PR. They are crucial to maintaining code quality.
- Document new code based on the [Rust documentation standards](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html).
- End all files with a newline.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    - üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    - üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    - etc.

### Rust Styleguide

- Use [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) to format your code.
- Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).

Thank you for contributing to RTLA!
